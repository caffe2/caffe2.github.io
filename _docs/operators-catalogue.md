## APMeter


APMeter computes Average Precision for binary or multi-class classification.
It takes two inputs: prediction scores P of size (n_samples x n_classes), and true labels Y of size (n_samples x n_classes). It returns a single float number per class for the average precision of that class.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`buffer_size` | (int32_t) indicates how many predictions should the op buffer. defaults to 1000
*Inputs* | 
`predictions` | 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size (num_samples xnum_classes) containing prediction scores
`labels` | 2-D tensor (Tensor<int>) of size (num_samples) containing true labels for each sample
*Outputs* | 
`AP` | 1-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size num_classes containing average precision for each class

## Accumulate


Accumulate operator accumulates the input tensor to the output tensor. If the output tensor already has the right size, we add to it; otherwise, we first initialize the output tensor to all zeros, and then do accumulation. Any further calls to the operator, given that no one else fiddles with the output in the interim, will do simple accumulations.
Accumulation is done using Axpby operation as shown:  

```
  Y = 1*X + gamma*Y
```

 where X is the input tensor, Y is the output tensor and gamma is the multiplier argument.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`gamma` | (float, default 1.0) Accumulation multiplier
*Inputs* | 
`input` | The input tensor that has to be accumulated to the output tensor. If the output size is not the same as input size, the output tensor is first reshaped and initialized to zero, and only then, accumulation is done.
*Outputs* | 
`output` | Accumulated output tensor

## Accuracy


Accuracy takes two inputs- predictions and labels, and returns a float accuracy value for the batch. Predictions are expected in the form of 2-D tensor containing a batch of scores for various classes, and labels are expected in the  form of 1-D tensor containing true label indices of samples in the batch. If the score for the label index in the predictions is the highest among all classes, it is considered a correct prediction.



### Interface

## Add


Performs element-wise binary addition (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`broadcast` | Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
`axis` | If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
*Inputs* | 
`A` | First operand, should share the type with the second operand.
`B` | Second operand. With broadcasting can be of smaller size than A. If broadcasting is disabled it should be of the same size.
*Outputs* | 
`C` | Result, has same dimensions and type as A

## Alias


Makes the output and the input share the same underlying storage.
 WARNING: in general, in caffe2's operator interface different tensors should have different underlying storage, which is the assumption made by components such as the dependency engine and memory optimization. Thus, in normal situations you should not use the AliasOp, especially in a normal forward-backward pass.
 The Alias op is provided so one can achieve true asynchrony, such as Hogwild, in a graph. But make sure you understand all the implications similar to multi-thread computation before you use it explicitly.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`input` | Input tensor whose storage will be shared.
*Outputs* | 
`output` | Tensor of same shape as input, sharing its storage.

Both input operands should be of type  `bool` .
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar

## BatchBucketOneHot


Input is a matrix tensor. Its first dimension is the batch size. For each column, bucketize it based on the boundary values and then do one hot encoding. The  `lengths`  specifies the number of boundary values for each column. The final number of buckets is this number plus 1. This would also be the expanded feature size.  `boundaries`  specifies all the boundary values.
Note that each bucket is right-inclusive. That is, given boundary values [b1, b2, b3], the buckets are defined as (-int, b1], (b1, b2], (b2, b3], (b3, inf).
For example   

```
  If data = [[2, 3], [4, 1], [2, 5]], lengths = [2, 3],
  and boundaries = [0.1, 2.5, 1, 3.1, 4.5], then

  output = [[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]]

```

## BatchDenseToSparse


This Op is a inverse of BatchSparseToDenseOp.
Basically, given a  `lengths`  vector, a  `indices`  vector, and a dense matrix  `dense` , output  `value`  vector so that, along with  `lengths`  vector and  `indices`  vector, forms a sparse representation of the dense matrix.
 A sparse matrix is represented by  `lengths`  vector,  `indices`  vector, and  `values`  vector. Each element in  `lengths`  vector (lengths[ `i` ]) represents the number of indices in this batch (batch  `i` ).
With in each batch,  `indices`  should not have duplicate number.
 For example, with input:   

```
  lengths = [2, 3, 1]
  indices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  output = [[6, 7, 0, 0, 0,  0],
            [0, 0, 8, 9, 10, 0],
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 11]]

```

 The output is:   

```
  values = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

```

 after running this operator.

## BooleanUnmask


Given a series of mask and values, reconstruct values together according to masks.
 A comprehensive example:

  mask2   = False, True, False, False, False
  values2 = 2.0
  mask3   = False, False, False, True, True
  values3 = 4.0, 5.0

```

 Reconstruct by:  

```
  output = net.BooleanUnmask([mask1, values1, mask2, values2, mask3, values3], ["output"])

 We get:  

```
  output = 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0

```

 Note that for all mask positions, there must be at least one True. If for a field there are multiple True's, we will accept the first value. For example:   Example 1:  

```
  mask1   = True, False
  values1 = 1.0
  mask2   = False, False
  values2 =

```

 This is not allowed:  

```

```
  mask1   = True, False
  values1 = 1.0
  mask2   = True, True
  values2 = 2.0, 2.0

## ChannelBackpropStats


Given an input tensor in NCHW format, the gradient for the output of SpatialBN and the per-channel mean and inverse std var vectors for the input, computes the per-channel bias and scale gradient to be used during the backward pass for subsequent spatial batch normalization gradient calculation. Typically, the results of this op are subsequently reduced over multiple devices to obtain statistics over a larger batch size in cases where the batch size for a single model copy is too low to yield the full benefit of batch normalization. The resulting bias and scale can then be plugged back into SpatialBNGradient to get results over the larger batch size

## ClipTensorByScaling


 

```
    Clips the input tensor by scaling based on the input value and the threshold.
    The value is usually the (pre-computed) norm of the tensor. If the value is
    larger than the threshold, scaling would be performed in this way:

          tensor *= (threshold / value).

    An optional input called additional_threshold can be provided which
    will scale the original threshold before it is used. That is,
    the final threshold will become threshold * additional_threshold.
    This op could be used for gradient clipping.
```

`threshold` | Threshold to determine whether to scale down the tensor
*Inputs* | 
`input_tensor` | Tensor of floats to be clipped.

`additional_threshold` | An optional additonal threshold to scale the orignal threshold
*Outputs* | 
`clipped` | Tensor of floats, which is the same size as the input tensor, representing the clipped tensor.

## Conv


The convolution operator consumes an input vector, a filter blob and a bias blob and computes the output.  Note that other parameters, such as the stride and kernel size, or the pads' sizes in each direction are not necessary for input because they are provided by the ConvPoolOpBase operator. Various dimension checks are done implicitly, and the sizes are specified in the Input docs for this operator. As is expected, the filter is convolved with a subset of the image and the bias is added; this is done throughout the image data and the output is computed. As a side note on the implementation layout: conv_op_impl.h is the templated implementation of the conv_op.h file, which is why they are separate files.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`X` | Input data blob from previous layer; has size (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and width. Note that this is for the NCHW usage. On the other hand, the NHWC Op has a different set of dimension constraints. 
`filter` | The filter blob that will be used in the convolutions; has size (M x C x kH x kW), where C is the number of channels, and kH and kW are the height and width of the kernel.
`bias` | The 1D bias blob that is added through the convolution; has size (M).
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | Output data blob that contains the result of the convolution. The output dimensions are functions of the kernel size, stride size, and pad lengths.

## CreateTreeCursor


Creates a cursor to iterate through a list of tensors, where some of those tensors contains the lengths in a nested schema. The schema is determined by the  `fields`  arguments.
 For example, to represent the following schema:   

```
  Struct(
      a=Int(),
      b=List(List(Int),
      c=List(
          Struct(
```

   

```
            c1=String,
```

   

```
            c2=List(Int),
          ),
      ),
  )

```

 the field list will be:  

```
  [
      "a",
      "b:lengths",
      "b:values:lengths",
      "b:values:values",
      "c:lengths",
      "c:c1",
      "c:c2:lengths",
      "c:c2:values",
  ]

```

 And for the following instance of the struct:   

```
  Struct(
      a=3,
      b=[[4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [], [9]],
      c=[
          Struct(c1='alex', c2=[10, 11]),
          Struct(c1='bob', c2=[12]),
      ],
  )

```

 The values of the fields will be:  

```
  {
      "a": [3],
      "b:lengths": [4],
      "b:values:lengths": [2, 3, 0, 1],
      "b:values:values": [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
      "c:lengths": [2],
      "c:c1": ["alex", "bob"],
      "c:c2:lengths": [2, 1],
      "c:c2:values", [10, 11, 12],
  }

```

 In general, every field name in the format "{prefix}:lengths" defines a domain "{prefix}", and every subsequent field in the format "{prefix}:{field}" will be in that domain, and the length of the domain is provided for each entry of the parent domain. In the example, "b:lengths" defines a domain of length 4, so every field under domain "b" will have 4 entries.
The "lengths" field for a given domain must appear before any reference to that domain.
 Returns a pointer to an instance of the Cursor, which keeps the current offset on each of the domains defined by  `fields` . Cursor also ensures thread-safety such that ReadNextBatch and ResetCursor can be used safely in parallel.
 A cursor does not contain data per se, so calls to ReadNextBatch actually need to pass a list of blobs containing the data to read for each one of the fields.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`fields` | A list of strings each one representing a field of the dataset.
*Outputs* | 
`cursor` | A blob pointing to an instance of a new TreeCursor.

## CrossEntropy


Operator computes the cross entropy between the input and the label set. In  practice, it is most commonly used at the end of models, after the SoftMax  operator and before the AveragedLoss operator. Note that CrossEntropy  assumes that the soft labels provided is a 2D array of size N x D  (batch size x number of classes). Each entry in the 2D label corresponds to  the soft label for the input, where each element represents the correct  probability of the class being selected. As such, each element must be between  0 and 1, and all elements in an entry must sum to 1. The formula used is:   

```
                Y[i] = sum_j (label[i][j] * log(X[i][j]))

```

  where (i, j) is the classifier's prediction of the jth class (the correct one),  and i is the batch size. Each log has a lower limit for numerical stability.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`X` | Input blob from the previous layer, which is almost always the result of a softmax operation; X is a 2D array of size N x D, where N is the batch size and D is the number of classes
`label` | Blob containing the labels used to compare the input
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | Output blob after the cross entropy computation

## DiagonalFill


The operator fills the diagonal elements of the output tensor (>= 2D) with a constant value specified by the 'value' argument, and others 0. If number of dimensions of the output tensor is greater than 2, all dimensions must be equal.
 The data type is specified by the 'dtype' argument. The 'dtype' argument must be one of the data types specified in the 'DataType' enum field in the TensorProto message. If the 'dtype' argument is not provided, the data type of 'value' is used.
 The output tensor shape is specified by the 'shape' argument. If the number of input is 1, the shape will be identical to that of the input at run time with optional additional dimensions appended at the end as specified by 'extra_shape' argument. In that case the 'shape' argument should not be set.
 If input_as_shape is set to true, then the input should be a 1D tensor containing the desired output shape (the dimensions specified in extra_shape will also be appended)  NOTE: Currently, it supports data type of float, int32, int64, and bool.

## Div


Performs element-wise binary division (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.

The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):

Therefore, sparse gradient can be back propagated to Operators that consume dense gradients only (e.g., FCGradient).
 The operator's behaviors:  - In forward, simply pass in place or copy input to the output.
- In backward, if the gradient passed-in is sparse gradient, change it to dense gradient in linear time; otherwise, simply pass the dense gradient.



### Interface

  Given a tensor such that tensor.Shape() = [3, 4, 5], then
  ExpandDims(tensor, dims=[0, 4]).Shape() == [1, 3, 4, 5, 1])

```

 If the same blob is provided in input and output, the operation is copy-free.

## ExtendTensor


Extend input 0 if necessary based on max element in input 1.
Input 0 must be the same as output, that is, it is required to be in-place.
Input 0 may have to be re-allocated in order for accommodate to the new size.
Currently, an exponential growth ratio is used in order to ensure amortized constant time complexity.
All except the outer-most dimension must be the same between input 0 and 1.



### Interface

`tensor` | The tensor to be extended.
`new_indices` | The size of tensor will be extended based on max element in new_indices.

## FC


Computes the result of passing an input vector X into a fully connected layer with 2D weight matrix W and 1D bias vector b. That is, the layer computes Y = X * W^T + b, where X has size (M x K), W has size (N x K), b has size (N), and Y has size (M x N), where M is often the batch size.
  NOTE: X does not need to explicitly be a 2D vector; rather, it will be coerced into one. For an arbitrary n-dimensional tensor X \in [a_0, a_1, ...,a_{k-1}, a_k, ..., a_{n-1}] where a_i \in N+ and k is the axis provided, then X will be coerced into a 2-dimensional tensor with dimensions [a_0  * ... *  a_{k-1}, a_k  * ... *  a_{n-1}]. For the default case where axis=1, this means the X tensor will be coerced into a 2D tensor of dimensions [a_0, a_1  * ... *  a_{n-1}], where a_0 is often the batch size.
In this situation, we must have a_0 = M and a_1  * ... *  a_{n-1} = K.
Lastly, even though b is a 1D vector of size N, it is copied/resized to be size (M x N) implicitly and added to each vector in the batch.
Each of these dimensions must be matched correctly, or else the operator will throw errors.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`axis` | (int32_t) default to 1; describes the axis of the inputs; defaults to one because the 0th axis most likely describes the batch_size
`axis_w` | (int32_t) default to 1; describes the axis of the weight matrix W; defaults to one because the 0th axis most likely describes the batch_size
`float16_compute` | Whether to use float-16 compute kernel
*Inputs* | 
`X` | input tensor that's coerced into a 2D matrix of size (MxK) as described above
`W` | A tensor that is coerced into a 2D blob of size (KxN) containing fully connected weight matrix
`b` | 1D blob containing bias vector
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | 2D output tensor

## FlexibleTopK


Given two tensors: X and K, retrieve the top K[..., 1] elements from X on the last dimension.
X is an input tensor of shape [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, r].
K is an input tensor of shape [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, 1], where for each element, r >= K[..., 1] > 0 Output two outputs: -Flatten values tensor of shape [ \sum_i K[i, 1] ] which contains the values of  the top K[..., 1] 

```
  elements along the last dimension
```

 -Flatten indices tensor of shape [ \sum_i K[i, 1] ] which contains the indices  of the top K[..., 1] 

```
  elements, flatten indices from the input tensor).
```

 These two outputs should be used with the input K, so that we know which indices in X are picked.
 Given two equivalent values, this operator uses the indices along the last dim- ension as a tiebreaker. That is, the element with the lower index will appear first.

## FloatToFused8BitRowwiseQuantized


Applies 8-bit row-wise quantization by determining the range (maximum - minimum) and offset (minimum value) of each row in the input matrix, and then scaling each element to an 8-bit number between 0 and 255. To later de-quantize values, the scale (range / 255) and offset (bias) are stored alongside the data. More precisely, the first 4 bytes of each row in the output matrix are a 32-bit float storing the scale, the next 4 bytes store the bias as a 32-bit float, and all remaining bytes in the row encode single quantized values.) 


### Interface

## FloatToRowwiseQuantized8Bits


This operator applies 8Bit row-wise quantization to input tensor and returns quantized tensor. Row wise quantization of input tensor is the following process. We take tensor of size (m_1, m_2,...,m_n), n >= 2, reshape it into matrix of size (m_1, m_2 x... x m_n) and apply row-wise quantization. After this, we compute scale_i= (min_i - max_i) / 255 and 

```
  bias_i = min_i for
```

 i-th row r_i of reshaped matrix, where min_i and max_i -- 

```
  minimum
```

 and maximum elements of i-th row, and quantize each element r_{ij} as 0 <= round(r_ij - bias_i) / scale_i) < 256. Instead of input tensor we obtain uint8 tensor and auxiliary information as scale and bias to restore input tensor (with losses).

## Fused8BitRowwiseQuantizedToFloat


De-quantizes the result of the FloatToFused8BitRowwiseQuantized operator. The input is expected to encode the scale as a 32-bit float in the second to the last 4 bytes of each row, followed by the bias as a 32-bit float in the next 4 bytes, and the quantized values in the preceding bytes of the row. The output is a matrix containing only the values, but de-quantized. De-quantization is performed by multiplying each value by its row's scale and bias parameters. The de-quantized values will thus not be exactly equal to the original, un-quantized floating point values.



### Interface

*Inputs* | 
`scale_bias_quantized_input` | Fused scale, bias and quantized data
*Outputs* |

## GE


Performs element-wise greater or equal than comparison  `>=`  (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`broadcast` | Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
`axis` | If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
*Inputs* | 
`A` | First operand, should share the type with the second operand.
`B` | Second operand. With broadcasting can be of smaller size than A. If broadcasting is disabled it should be of the same size.
*Outputs* | 
`C` | Result, has same dimensions and A and type `bool`

## HSoftmax


Hierarchical softmax is an operator which approximates the softmax operator while giving significant training speed gains and reasonably comparable performance. In this operator, instead of calculating the probabilities of all the classes, we calculate the probability of each step in the path from root to the target word in the hierarchy.
 The operator takes a 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) containing a batch of layers, a set of parameters represented by the weight matrix and bias terms, and a 1-D tensor (Tensor<int>) holding labels, or the indices of the target class. The hierarchy has to be specified as an argument to the operator.
 The operator returns a 1-D tensor holding the computed log probability of the target class and a 2-D tensor of intermediate outputs (from the weight matrix and softmax from each step in the path from root to target class) which will be used by the gradient operator to compute gradients for all samples in the batch.

`hierarchy` | Serialized HierarchyProto string containing list of vocabulary words and their paths from root of hierarchy to the leaf
*Inputs* |

`b` | 1D blob with N parameters
`labels` | int word_id of the target word
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | 1-D of log probability outputs, one per sample
`intermediate_output` | Extra blob to store the intermediate FC and softmax outputs for each node in the hierarchical path of a word. The outputs from samples are stored in consecutive blocks in the forward pass and are used in reverse order in the backward gradientOp pass

Carries out instance normalization as described in the paper  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08022.)  Depending on the mode it is being run, there are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:   

```
  * Output case #1: output
  * Output case #2: output, saved_mean
    - don't use, doesn't make sense but won't crash
  * Output case #3: output, saved_mean, saved_inv_stdev
    - Makes sense for training only

```

 For training mode, type 3 is faster in the sense that for the backward pass, it is able to reuse the saved mean and inv_stdev in the gradient computation.

## LC


The locally connected operator consumes an input vector, a filter blob and a bias blob and computes the output.  Note that other parameters, such as the stride and kernel size, or the pads' sizes in each direction are not necessary for input because they are provided by the ConvPoolOpBase operator. Various dimension checks are done implicitly, and the sizes are specified in the Input docs for this operator. As is expected, the filter is locally connected with a subset of the image and the bias is added; this is done throughout the image data and the output is computed. As a side note on the implementation layout: locally_connected_op_impl.h is the templated implementation of the locally_connected_op.h file, which is why they are separate files.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`None` | 
`filter` | The filter blob that will be used in the locally connected op; has size (YH * YW * M x C x kH x kW), where YH and YW are the height and width of the output image, C is the number of channels, and kH and kW are the height and width of the kernel.
`bias` | The 1D bias blob that is added through the locally connected op; has size (YH * YW * M).
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | Output data blob that contains the result of the locally connected op.The output dimensions are functions of the kernel size, stride size, and pad lengths.

## LE


Performs element-wise less or equal than comparison  `<=`  (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`broadcast` | Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
`axis` | If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
*Inputs* | 
`A` | First operand, should share the type with the second operand.

## LabelCrossEntropy


Operator computes the cross entropy between the input and the label set. In  practice, it is most commonly used at the end of models, after the SoftMax  operator and before the AveragedLoss operator. Note that LabelCrossEntropy  assumes that the label provided is either a 1D array of size N (batch size), or  a 2D array of size N x 1 (batch size). Each entry in the label vector indicates  which is the correct class; as such, each entry must be between 0 and D - 1,  inclusive, where D is the total number of classes. The formula used is:   

```
                            Y[i] = -log(X[i][j])

```

  where (i, j) is the classifier's prediction of the jth class (the correct one),  and i is the batch size. Each log has a lower limit for numerical stability.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`X` | Input blob from the previous layer, which is almost always the result of a softmax operation; X is a 2D array of size N x D, where N is the batch size and D is the number of classes
`label` | Blob containing the labels used to compare the input
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | Output blob after the cross entropy computation

## Lars


Implement Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) as in  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03888.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03888.)  Without weight decay, given a global learning rate lr, parameter tensor X and its gradient dX, the local learning rate for X will be   

```
    local_lr = lr * norm(X) / ( norm(dX) + offset * norm(X) )

```

   

```
            = lr  / ( norm(dX) / norm(X) + offset ),

```

 where offset is a preset hyper-parameter to avoid numerical issue.
In this implementation, we uses l2 norm and output the rescaling factor   

```
    1 / ( norm(dX) / norm(X) + offset ).

```




### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`offset` | rescaling offset parameter

## LastNWindowCollector


Collect the last N rows from input data. The purpose is to keep track of data accross batches, so for example suppose the LastNWindowCollector is called successively with the following input data   

```
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  [5, 6, 7]
  [8, 9, 10, 11]

```

 And the number of items is set to 6, then the output after the 3rd call will contain the following elements:   

```
  [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]

```

 No guarantee is made on the ordering of elements in input. So a valid value for output could have been   

```
  [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6]

```

 Also, this method works for any order tensor, treating the first dimension as input rows and keeping the last N rows seen as input. So for instance:   

```
  [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]
  [[5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8]]
  [[8, 9], [9, 10], [10, 11], [11, 12]]

```

 A possible output would be   

```
  [[6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10], [10, 11], [11, 12]]

```

 This is not thread safe unless a mutex is given.



### Interface

`num_to_collect` | The number of random samples to append for each positive samples

`NUM_VISITED` | 
*Outputs* |

## LayerNorm


Computes layer normalization as described in  [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450.pdf.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.06450.pdf.) 
Given an input vector x \in [a_0, a_1, ...,a_{k-1}, a_k, ..., a_{n-1}], this op treats dimensions a_k through a_{n-1} as feature vectors. For each feature vector, the op contains the mean and standard deviation. Then, it returns the normalized values (with respect to the feature vector).
 Note that this op does not contain the scale an bias terms described in the paper. Simply follow this op with an FC op to add those. Concretely, this op implements:  h = \frac{1}{\sigma}(a - \mu) where \mu = \frac{1}{H}\sum_{i=1}^{H} a_i and \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{H}\sum_{i=1}^{H}(a_i - \mu)^2} where H is the number of hidden units (i.e. product of dimensions from 'axis' to the end.) 


### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`axis` | (int) default to 1; Describes axis of the inputs. Defaults to one because the 0th axis most likely describes the batch size
`epsilon` | (float) default to 0.001. Small value to be added to the stdev when dividing out by that value. This prevents division by zero.
*Inputs* | 
`input` | Input tensor which layer normalization will be applied to
*Outputs* | 
`output` | Normalized values
`mean` | Mean values for each feature vector
`stddev` | Standard deviations for each feature vector

## LengthsGather


Gather items from sparse tensor. Sparse tensor is described by items and lengths. This operator gathers items corresponding to lengths at the given indices. This deliberately doesn't return lengths of OUTPUTS so that both lists and maps can be supported without special cases. If you need lengths tensor for  OUTPUT, use  `Gather` .
 Example:  

```
  ITEMS = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
  LENGTHS = [0, 2, 3, 1, 4]
  INDICES = [0, 2, 4]

## LengthsPartition


LengthsPartition splits the input int tensor into multiple ones according to the second tensor. The first dimension is expected to be the tensor that describes lengths of the elements.
 Takes the second input and partitions it to shards according to the remainder of values modulo the number of partitions. It requires the second tensor to be a 1D-tensor of the integral type. The first tensor should be 1D-tensor of int32 that would represent the lengths of the elements in the input. The number of partitions is derived as (num_output / num_input).
 If additional inputs are present they must have the same shape as the first input, optionally with extra trailing dimensions. They will be partitioned accordingly to the first input.
 Optional arg 'pack_first_input' transforms the first tensor values as X_ij / num_partitions.
 Outputs are ordered as X_0_part_0, X_1_part_0, ..., X_N-1_part_0, X_0_part_1, ..., X_N-1_part_K-1

## MaxPool

MaxPool  consumes an input blob X and applies max pooling across the the blob according to kernel sizes, stride sizes, and pad lengths defined by the ConvPoolOpBase operator. Max pooling consisting of taking the maximum value of a subset of the input tensor according to the kernel size and downsampling the data into the output blob Y for further processing.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`X` | Input data tensor from the previous operator; dimensions depend on whether the NCHW or NHWC operators are being used. For example, in the former, the input has size (N x C x H x W), where N is the batch size, C is the number of channels, and H and W are the height and the width of the data. The corresponding permutation of dimensions is used in the latter case.
*Outputs* | 
`Y` | Output data tensor from max pooling across the input tensor. Dimensions will vary based on various kernel, stride, and pad sizes.

## MergeIdLists


MergeIdLists: Merge multiple ID_LISTs into a single ID_LIST.
 An ID_LIST is a list of IDs (may be ints, often longs) that represents a single feature. As described in  [https://caffe2.ai/docs/sparse-operations.html,](https://caffe2.ai/docs/sparse-operations.html,)  a batch of ID_LIST examples is represented as a pair of lengths and values where the  `lengths`  (int32) segment the  `values`  or ids (int32/int64) into examples.
 Given multiple inputs of the form lengths_0, values_0, lengths_1, values_1, ...
which correspond to lengths and values of ID_LISTs of different features, this operator produces a merged ID_LIST that combines the ID_LIST features. The final merged output is described by a lengths and values vector.
 WARNING: The merge makes no guarantee about the relative order of ID_LISTs within a batch. This can be an issue if ID_LIST are order sensitive.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`lengths_0` | Lengths of the ID_LISTs batch for first feature
`values_0` | Values of the ID_LISTs batch for first feature
*Outputs* |

## MomentumSGD


 Computes a momentum SGD update for an input gradient and momentum parameters. Concretely, given inputs (grad, m, lr) and parameters (momentum, nesterov), computes:   

```
    if not nesterov:
        adjusted_gradient = lr * grad + momentum * m
        return (adjusted_gradient, adjusted_gradient)
    else:
        m_new = momentum * m + lr * grad
        return ((1 + momentum) * m_new - momentum * m, m_new)

```

```
    if not nesterov:
        adjusted_gradient = lr * grad + momentum * m

        return (adjusted_gradient, adjusted_gradient, param)
    else:
        m_new = momentum * m + lr * grad
        param = param - ((1 + momentum) * m_new - momentum * m),
        return ((1 + momentum) * m_new - momentum * m, m_new, param)

```

 Output is (grad, momentum, parameter).
 Note the difference to MomentumSGD, which returns a new gradient but does not perform the parameter update.

## Mul


Performs element-wise binary multiplication (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`broadcast` | Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
`axis` | If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
*Inputs* | 
`A` | First operand, should share the type with the second operand.

## ONNXWhile


 *** EXPERIMENTAL. This operator is a work-in-progress. No assumption should be made about the stability or correctness of this op. ** *  Generic Looping construct confirming to the ONNX Loop operator spec. This loop has multiple termination conditions:  1. Trip count. Iteration count specified at runtime. Set by specifying the  

```
    input M. Optional. Set to empty string to omit. Note that a static trip
    count (specified at graph construction time) can be specified by passing
    in a constant node for input M.
```

 2. Loop termination condition. This is an input to the op that determines  

```
    whether to run the first interation and also a loop-carried dependency for
    the body graph. The body graph must yield a value for the condition
    variable, whether this input is provided or not.

```

 This table summarizes the operating modes of this operator with equivalent C-style code:  Operator inputs defined as (max_trip_count, condition_var). Omitted optional inputs are represented as empty string. Concretely, in this caffe2 op an input is marked as omitted by setting its 'has_{name}' argument to False.
  

```
    input ("", ""):
        for (int i=0; ; ++i) {
          cond = ... // Note this value is ignored, but is required in the body
        }

    input ("", cond) // Note this is analogous to a while loop
        bool cond = ...;
        for (int i=0; cond; ++i) {
          cond = ...;
        }

    input ("", 1) // Note this is analogous to a do-while loop
        bool cond = true
        for (int i=0; cond; ++i) {
          cond = ...;
        }

    input (trip_count, "") // Note this is analogous to a for loop
        int trip_count = ...

## Or


Performs element-wise logical operation  `or`  (with limited broadcast support).
Both input operands should be of type  `bool` .
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```

## PackRNNSequence


Pack values based on the length blob. Each number from length blob represents the corresponding values that need to be packed. The dimension for each pack is the same as the maximum number from the length blob (padding with zero is implemented for smaller length value). The overall output dimension is: T  * N *  D, where T is the max number of lengths, N is the size of lengths, and D is the dimension of each feature value. The following example shows the input and output of this operator:   Given:  

```
  values = [v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8]
  lengths = [2, 3, 1, 2];


```

 Output:  

```
  output = [
    [v1, v3, v6, v7],
    [v2, v4, 0,  v8],
    [0,  v5, 0,  0 ],
  ]


```

 One application for this operator is the transfer data into the format that is used for RNN models. Note that the gradient operator of PackRNNSequence is UnpackRNNSequence.

## Partition


Splits the input int tensor into multiple ones according to the first tensor.
 Takes the first input and partitions it to shards according to the remainder of values modulo the number of partitions. It requires that the first tensor is of integral type. The number of partitions is derived as (num_output / num_input).
 If additional inputs are present they must have the same shape as the first input, optionally with extra trailing dimensions. They will be partitioned accordingly to the first input.
 Optional arg 'pack_first_input' transforms the first tensor values as X_ij / num_partitions.
 Outputs are ordered as X_0_part_0, X_1_part_0, ..., X_N-1_part_0, X_0_part_1, ..., X_N-1_part_K-1 


### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`pack_first_input` | (int, default 0) If set, the operator transforms the first tensor values as floor(X_ij / num_partitions)
*Inputs* | 
`input` | Input tensor containing data to be partitioned. The number of input tensors might be greater than 1 but must have the same shape as the previous tensors.
*Outputs* | 
`partitions` | Output Partitions. The number of output tensors has to be a multiple of the number of input tensors.

## Percentile


 

```
    This operator is used to find percentile representations for raw values, given a sample
    set of raw values, labeled with their corresponding percentiles from the same distribution.
    In particular, this operator takes as input a tensor of floats to find the percentile values
    for, a 2D tensor of floats, where the first column of the tensor represents sampled values,
    and the second column represents the percentile labels, and a tensor  of integers lengths.

    This lengths tensor is used because the operator works on multiple sets of raw values at the same time. For
    example, for an input:
    original_values=[[3, 5, 3],[5, 1, 6]], lengths = [2, 1, 1], value_to_pct = [[3, 0.2], [5, 0.5], [1, 0.3], [3. 0.6]]

    Our operator expects that each column i of the input tensor is sampled from distribution i. Lengths tells
    us that the first two elements in value_to_pct are sampled from distribution 1, the next is from distribution two,
    and the last is from distribution 3. We expect the output of our operator to give us [[0.2, 1.0, 0.6], [0.5, 0.3, 1.0]].

    To calculate the percentile of an element, we check to see if its value is already mapped to
    a percentile in value_to_pct. If so, we return that value. If not, we linearly interpolate between
    the two closest values in value_to_pct. If the value is larger than all values in value_to_pct, we
    return 1. If it's smaller than all the values, we return 0.

```




### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`original_values` | Input 2D tensor of floats, representing the original, raw data to calculate percentiles for.
`value_to_pct` | Sorted 2D tensor, with 2 columns. Each element in the first column is a float representing the raw value of a sample. Its corresponding element in the next column represents the percentile it maps to.
`lengths` | 1D tensor, representing the length of each distribution. We expect that the sum of elements of this tensor is equal to the total length of value_to_pct.
*Outputs* | 
`percentile_values` | 1D tensor of floats, with the same dimensions as the flattened input tensor. Each element of this tensor, percentile_values[i], corresponds to the percentile calculated for original_values[i].

## Perplexity


Perplexity calculates how well a probability distribution predicts a sample.
Perplexity takes a 1-D tensor containing a batch of probabilities. Each value in the tensor belongs to a different sample and represents the probability of the model predicting the true label for that sample. The operator returns a single (float) perplexity value for the batch.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`probabilities` | The input data as Tensor. It contains a batch oftrue label or target probabilities
*Outputs* | 
`output` | The output- a single (float) perplexity value for the batch

## PiecewiseLinearTransform


PiecewiseLinearTransform takes inputs -- predictions, a 2-D or 1-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size (batch_size x prediction_dimensions). The piecewise linear functions are stored in bounds, slopes and intercepts. The output tensor has the same shape of input  `predictions`  and contains the predictions transformed by the piecewise linear functions. Each column of predictions has its own piecewise linear transformation functions. Therefore the size of piecewise function parameters are pieces x prediction_dimensions, except for binary predictions where only the positive prediction needs them. Note that in each piece, low bound is excluded while high bound is included. Also the piecewise linear function must be continuous.
 Notes - If the input is binary predictions (Nx2 or Nx1 tensor), set the binary arg to true so that one group of piecewise linear functions is needed (see details below).
- The transform parameters (bounds, slopes, intercepts) can be passed either through args or through input blobs.
- If we have multiple groups of piecewise linear functions, each group has the same number of pieces.
- If a prediction is out of the bounds, it is capped to the smallest or largest bound.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`bounds` | 1-D vector of size (prediction_dimensions x (pieces+1)) contain the upper bounds of each piece of linear function. One special case is the first bound is the lower bound of whole piecewise function and we treat it the same as the left most functions. (bounds, slopes, intercepts) can be passed through either arg or input blobs.
`slopes` | 1-D vector of size (prediction_dimensions x pieces) containing the slopes of linear function
`intercepts` | 1-D vector of size (prediction_dimensions x pieces) containing the intercepts of linear function
`binary` | If set true, we assume the input is a Nx1 or Nx2 tensor. If it is Nx1 tensor, it is positive predictions. If the input is Nx2 tensor, its first column is negative predictions and second column is positive and negative + positive = 1. We just need one group of piecewise linear functions for the positive predictions.
*Inputs* | 
`predictions` | 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size (num_batches x num_classes) containing scores
`bounds (optional)` | See bounds in Arg. (bounds, slopes, intercepts) can be passed through either arg or input blobs.
`slopes (optional)` | See slopes in Arg. (bounds, slopes, intercepts) can be passed through either arg or input blobs.
`intercepts (optional)` | See intercepts in Arg. (bounds, slopes, intercepts) can be passed through either arg or input blobs.
*Outputs* |

## RecurrentNetwork


Run the input network in a recurrent fashion. This can be used to implement fairly general recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
 The operator proceeds as follows.
 - First, initialized the states from the input recurrent states - For each timestep T, apply the links (that map offsets from input/output tensors into the inputs/outputs for the  `step`  network) - Finally, alias the recurrent states to the specified output blobs.
 This is a fairly special-case meta-operator, and so the implementation is somewhat complex. It trades of generality (and frankly usability) against performance and control (compared to e.g. TF dynamic_rnn, Theano scan, etc).
 See the usage examples for a flavor of how to use it.

## ScatterAssign


Update slices of the tensor in-place by overriding current value.
 Note: The op pretty much ignores the exact shapes of the input arguments and cares only about sizes. It's done for performance consideration to avoid unnecessary reshapes. Only first dimension of X_0 is important, let's call it N. If M is the total size of X_0 and K is the size of INDICES then X_i is assumed to be of shape K x (M / N) regardless of the real shape.
 Note: Each update in INDICES is applied independently which means that if duplicated elements are present in INDICES arbitrary one will win.
 Currently only works on CPU because of access to INDICES.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`DATA` | Tensor to be updated.
`INDICES` | 1-D list of indices on the first dimensionof X_0 that need to be updated
`SLICES` | Update slices, with shape len(INDICES) + shape(X_0)[1:]
*Outputs* | 
`DATA` | Has to be exactly the same tensor as the input 0

---



## ScatterWeightedSum


Similar to WeightedSum, computes the weighted sum of several tensors, with the difference that inputs are sliced tensors. The first tensor has to be in-place and only slices of it on the first dimension as indexed by INDICES will be updated.
 Note: The op pretty much ignores the exact shapes of the input arguments and cares only about sizes. It's done for performance consideration to avoid unnecessary reshapes. Only first dimension of X_0 is important, let's call it N. If M is the total size of X_0 and K is the size of INDICES then X_i is assumed to be of shape K x (M / N) regardless of the real shape.
 Note: Each update in INDICES is applied independently which means that if duplicated elements are present in INDICES the corresponding slice of X_0 will be scaled multiple times. Manual collapsing of INDICES is required beforehand if necessary.
 Note: Updates are applied sequentially by inputs which might have undesired consequences if the input tensor is accessed concurrently by different op (e.g. when doing Hogwild). Other threads might see intermediate results even on individual slice level, e.g. X_0 scaled by weight_0 but without any updates applied.
 Currently only works on CPU because of access to INDICES.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Inputs* | 
`X_0` | Tensor to be updated.
`Weight_0` | Scalar weight for X_0, applied only to slices affected.
`INDICES` | 1-D list of indices on the first dimension of X_0 that need to be updated
`X_1` | Update slices, with shape len(INDICES) + shape(X_0)[1:]
`Weight_1` | Scalar weight for X_1 update
*Outputs* | 
`X_0` | Has to be exactly the same tensor as the input 0

## SequenceMask


Mask op designed for use in attention mechanisms for sequence modeling tasks.
Supports batching: given batch_dim, collapses dims 0 through batch_dim into a single dimension, e.g. if tensor dims are [4,2,1,3,4] and batch_dim=2, first collapse tensor to [4 *2* 1,3,4], then mask each batch [i,:,:].
  Two current operating modes:   1) Given a 2D input tensor and 1D tensor of sequence lengths, for each row i in the input tensor, set elements in that row to -inf if their column index j >= sequence_lengths[i]. This mode takes two inputs and argument mode = 'sequence'   2) Triangular mask. Given row index i and column index j, set elements to -inf given the following conditions:   

```
      mode='upper', x_ij = -inf if j < i
      mode='lower', x_ij = -inf if j > i
      mode='upperdiag', x_ij = -inf if j <= i
      mode='lowerdiag', x_ij = -inf if j >= i

```

 This mode takes one input.
  3) Window Mask. Given a 2D input tensor and 1D tensor of window centers, for each row i in the input tensor, set elements in that row to -inf if their column index j outside [center - radius, center + radius].
This mode takes two inputs and argument mode = 'sequence'.
Argument 'radius' should be provided.

## SinusoidPositionEncoding


Calculates a sinusoid position encoding tensor as described in  [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762.)  Takes a 2-D tensor (of size M x K) of positions as input, the embedding size as an argument, and outputs a position encoding tensor of size (M x K x embedding_size). Here M is typically the max sequence length and K is typically the batch size.
The input tensor must satisfy input[m, 0] == input[m, k] for all k.
 Encoded as amplitude  * SIN(pos/alpha^(i/embedding_size)) if i is even, else amplitude *  COS(pos/alpha^(i/embedding_size)).

## Slice


Produces a slice of the input tensor. Currently, only slicing in a single dimension is supported.
Slices are passed as 2 1D vectors or as two keyword argument lists with starting and end indices for each dimension of the input  `data`  tensor. If a negative value is passed for any of the start or end indices, it represents the number of elements before the end of that dimension. End indices are non-inclusive unless negative (end index -1 means up to and including the last element).
  Example:   

```
  data = [
      [1, 2, 3, 4],
      [5, 6, 7, 8],
  ]
  starts = [0, 1]
  ends = [-1, 3]

## Softmax


The operator computes the softmax normalized values for each layer in the batch  of the given input. The input is a 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size (batch_size x input_feature_dimensions). The output tensor has the same shape and contains the softmax normalized values of the corresponding input.
 X does not need to explicitly be a 2D vector; rather, it will be coerced into one. For an arbitrary n-dimensional tensor X \in [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{k-1}, a_k, ..., a_{n-1}] and k is the axis provided, then X will be coerced into a 2-dimensional tensor with dimensions [a_0  * ... *  a_{k-1}, a_k  * ... *  a_{n-1}]. For the default case where axis=1, this means the X tensor will be coerced into a 2D tensor of dimensions [a_0, a_1  * ... *  a_{n-1}], where a_0 is often the batch size.
In this situation, we must have a_0 = N and a_1  * ... *  a_{n-1} = D.
Each of these dimensions must be matched correctly, or else the operator will throw errors.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`axis` | (int) default to 1; describes the axis of the inputs when coerced to 2D; defaults to one because the 0th axis most likely describes the batch_size
*Inputs* |

*Outputs* | 
`output` | The softmax normalized output values with the same shape as input tensor.

## SoftmaxWithLoss


Combined Softmax and Cross-Entropy loss operator.
The operator computes the softmax normalized values for each layer in the batch of the given input, after which cross-entropy loss is computed. This operator is numerically more stable than separate Softmax and CrossEntropy ops.

 For example, we have data sorted as 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12  and batchSize = 2 and shuffleSize = 3, when we shuffle we get: [3,1,4,6,5,2] [12,10,11,8,9,7]  After this we will shuffle among different batches with size 2 [3,1],[4,6],[5,2],[12,10],[11,8],[9,7]  We may end up with something like [9,7],[5,2],[12,10],[4,6],[3,1],[11,8]  Input(0) is a blob pointing to a TreeCursor, and [Input(1),... Input(num_fields)] a list of tensors containing the data for each field of the dataset.

## SparseLengthsMean


Pulls in slices of the input tensor, groups them into segments and applies 'Mean' to each segment. Segments are defined by their LENGTHS.
 This op is basically Gather and LengthsMean fused together.
 INDICES should contain integers in range 0..N-1 where N is the first dimension of DATA. INDICES represent which slices of DATA need to be pulled in.
 LENGTHS is a vector that defines slice sizes by first dimention of DATA. Values belonging to the same segment are aggregated together. sum(LENGTHS) has to match INDICES size.
 The first dimension of the output is equal to the number of input segment, i.e.  `len(LENGTHS)` . Other dimensions are inherited from the input tensor.
 Mean computes the element-wise mean of the input slices. Operation doesn't change the shape of the individual blocks.

## SparseToDense


Convert sparse representations to dense with given indices.
 Transforms a sparse representation of map<id, value> represented as  `indices`  vector and  `values`  tensor into a compacted tensor where the first dimension is determined by the first dimension of the 3rd input if it is given or the max index. Missing values are filled with zeros.
 The op supports duplicated indices and performs summation over corresponding values. This behavior is useful for converting GradientSlices into dense representation.
 After running this op:   

```
  output[indices[i], :] += values[i]  # sum over all indices[i] equal to the index
  output[j, ...] = 0 if j not in indices
```




### Interface


---------- | ----------

*Outputs* | 
`output` | Output tensor of the same type as `values` of shape `[len(lengths), len(mask)] + shape(default_value)` (if `lengths` is not provided the first dimension is omitted)

## SparseToDenseMask


Convert sparse representations to dense with given indices.
 Transforms a sparse representation of map<id, value> represented as  `indices`  vector and  `values`  tensor into a compacted tensor where the first dimension corresponds to each id provided in mask argument. Missing values are filled with the value of  `default_value` . After running this op:   

```
  output[j, :] = values[i] # where mask[j] == indices[i]
  output[j, ...] = default_value # when mask[j] doesn't appear in indices

```

 If  `lengths`  is provided and not empty, and extra "batch" dimension is prepended to the output.
  `values`  and  `default_value`  can have additional matching dimensions, operation is performed on the entire subtensor in thise case.
 For example, if  `lengths`  is supplied and  `values`  is 1-D vector of floats and  `default_value`  is a float scalar, the output is going to be a float matrix of size  `len(lengths) X len(mask)`  


### Interface

`values` | Data tensor, first dimension has to match `indices`
`default_value` | Default value for the output if the id is not present in `indices`. Must have the same type as `values` and the same shape, but without the first dimension
`lengths` | Optional lengths to represent a batch of `indices` and `values`.
*Outputs* | 
`output` | Output tensor of the same type as `values` of shape `[len(lengths), len(mask)] + shape(default_value)` (if `lengths` is not provided the first dimension is omitted)
`presence_mask` | Bool tensor of shape `[len(lengths), len(mask)]` (if `lengths` is not provided the first dimension is omitted). True when a value for given id was present, false otherwise.

## SpatialSoftmaxWithLoss


Combined Spatial Softmax and Cross-Entropy loss operator.
Similar to SoftmaxWithLoss, this operator computes the spatial softmax normalized values for each layer in the batch of the given input, after which cross-entropy loss is computed. This operator is numerically more stable than separate Softmax and CrossEntropy ops. The inputs are a 2-D tensor (Tensor<float>) of size (batch_size x input_feature_dimensions) and tensor of labels (ground truth).
Output is tensor with the probability for each label in a pixel for each example (N x D x W x H) and averaged loss (scalar).
For spatial softmax, weighting is by x,y position of the input.

## Sub


Performs element-wise binary subtraction (with limited broadcast support).
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

## TT


The TT-layer serves as a low-rank decomposition of a fully connected layer. The inputs are the same as to a fully connected layer, but the number of parameters are greatly reduced and forward computation time can be drastically reduced especially for layers with large weight matrices. The multiplication is computed as a product of the input vector with each of the cores that make up the TT layer. Given the input sizes (inp_sizes), output sizes(out_sizes), and the ranks of each of the cores (tt_ranks), the ith core will have size:   

```
    inp_sizes[i] * tt_ranks[i] * tt_ranks[i + 1] * out_sizes[i].

```

 The complexity of the computation is dictated by the sizes of inp_sizes, out_sizes, and tt_ranks, where there is the trade off between accuracy of the low-rank decomposition and the speed of the computation.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`inp_sizes` | (int[]) Input sizes of cores. Indicates the input size of the individual cores; the size of the input vector X must match the product of the inp_sizes array.

`tt_ranks` | (int[]) Ranks of cores. Indicates the ranks of the individual cores; lower rank means larger compression, faster computation but reduce accuracy.
*Inputs* | 
`X` | Input tensor from previous layer with size (M x K), where M is the batch size and K is the input size.
`b` | 1D blob containing the bias vector
`cores` | 1D blob containing each individual cores with sizes specified above.

## TensorProtosDBInput


TensorProtosDBInput is a simple input operator that basically reads things from a db where each key-value pair stores an index as key, and a TensorProtos object as value. These TensorProtos objects should have the same size, and they will be grouped into batches of the given size. The DB Reader is provided as input to the operator and it returns as many output tensors as the size of the TensorProtos object. Each output will simply be a tensor containing a batch of data with size specified by the 'batch_size' argument containing data from the corresponding index in the TensorProtos objects in the DB.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`batch_size` | (int, default 0) the number of samples in a batch. The default value of 0 means that the operator will attempt to insert the entire data in a single output blob.
*Inputs* | 
`data` | A pre-initialized DB reader. Typically, this is obtained by calling CreateDB operator with a db_name and a db_type. The resulting output blob is a DB Reader tensor

## UniformFill


Fill the output tensor with FLOAT samples from uniform distribution [min, max].
 The range can be defined either by arguments or input blobs. If the range is given by input blobs, you also need to give the shape as input. When the range is given as arguments, this operator enforces min <= max. When the range is given as inputs, the constraint is not enforced. When MAX < MIN, the first dimension of the output is set to 0. This behavior is allowed so that dynamically sampling indices into a dynamically sized tensor is possible.
 The shape of the output can be given as argument or input.



### Interface

*Arguments* | 
`min` | minimum value, inclusive
`max` | maximum value, inclusive
`shape` | shape of the output, do not set when input_as_shape=1

## UnpackRNNSequence


This is the reverse operator for PackRNNSequence. It maps the packed values back to sequence values based on the length blob. Each number from length blob represents the corresponding values that has been grouped. The dimension for each pack is the same as the maximum number from the length blob (padding with zero was implemented for smaller length value). The overall output dimension is: M * D, where M is the sum of lengths, and D is the dimension of each feature value. The following example shows the input and output of this operator:   Given:  

```
  values = [
    [v1, v3, v6, v7],
    [v2, v4, 0,  v8],
    [0,  v5, 0,  0 ],
  ]
  lengths = [2, 3, 1, 2]


```

 Output:  

```
  output = [v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, v8];


```

 One application for this operator is the transfer data from the format of RNN back to sequence values. Note that the gradient operator of UnpackRNNSequence is PackRNNSequence.

*Inputs* | 
`values` | Data tensor, contains the packed features

## UnsafeCoalesce


Coalesce the N inputs into N outputs and a single coalesced output blob.
 This allows operations that operate over multiple small kernels (e.g.
biases in a deep CNN) to be coalesced into a single larger operation, amortizing the kernel launch overhead, synchronization costs for distributed computation, etc.
 The operator:  - computes the total size of the coalesced blob by summing the input sizes - allocates the coalesced output blob as the total size - copies the input vectors into the coalesced blob, at the correct offset.
- aliases each Output(i) to- point into the coalesced blob, at the corresponding offset for Input(i).
 This is 'unsafe' as the output vectors are aliased, so use with caution.

 If  `num_segments`  argument is passed it would be used as a first dimension for the output. Otherwise, it'd be dynamically calculated from as the max value of SEGMENT_IDS plus one. Other output dimensions are inherited from the input tensor.
 Mean computes the element-wise mean of the input slices. Operation doesn't change the shape of the individual blocks.

## Xor


Performs element-wise logical operation  `xor`  (with limited broadcast support).
Both input operands should be of type  `bool` .
 If necessary the right-hand-side argument will be broadcasted to match the shape of left-hand-side argument. When broadcasting is specified, the second tensor can either be of size 1 (a scalar value), or having its shape as a contiguous subset of the first tensor's shape. The starting of the mutually equal shape is specified by the argument "axis", and if it is not set, suffix matching is assumed. 1-dim expansion doesn't work yet.
 For example, the following tensor shapes are supported (with broadcast=1):   

```
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (,), i.e. B is a scalar
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (5,)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (4, 5)
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (3, 4), with axis=1
  shape(A) = (2, 3, 4, 5), shape(B) = (2), with axis=0

```

 Argument  `broadcast=1`  needs to be passed to enable broadcasting.



### Interface


---------- | ----------
*Arguments* | 
`broadcast` | Pass 1 to enable broadcasting
`axis` | If set, defines the broadcast dimensions. See doc for details.
*Inputs* | 
`A` | First operand.
`B` | Second operand. With broadcasting can be of smaller size than A. If broadcasting is disabled it should be of the same size.
*Outputs* | 
`C` | Result, has same dimensions and A and type `bool`
